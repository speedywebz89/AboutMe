      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a Front-End Web Developer based out of Lakeland, Florida. When i started my working career
        in 2005 at a young age i updated and maintained 4 different websites for 7 years. The companies main website was
        a very basic design using HTML and CSS. I've spent over 10 years in the car business and eventually switched
        careers paths to the printing industry where i became a successful Graphic Artist in the world of Bindery. After
        a very long hiatus away from my true passion, i somehow found my way back to designing and developing websites.
        I've become obsessed with the things we can do today compared to 2005. Wow! What a huge difference.
